# GoProControl
library to interface with GoPro camera

It is based on another gopro library: https://github.com/agdl/GoPRO which works only on arduino boards with gopro HERO3, this works also on ESP8266 (soon) both as standalone board or with AT-commands
also, this library has a cleaner interface and smarter code design to support not only the HERO3

all the commands came from: https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack

Todo list:
-use esp01 with AT-commands
-improve the url-making
-add more cameras
-extend the library to non-gopro camera
