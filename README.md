# GoProControl
this is a library to interface with GoPro camera

for more information see here: https://www.hackster.io/vincenzo-g/goprocontrol-arduino-9083e2

all the commands came from: https://github.com/KonradIT/goprowifihack

For now I just added my camera (HERO3+) but I made the library with a style which would be quite easy to add other cameras. I will be very happy to accept pull requests and have as collaborator other people

It is based on another gopro library: https://github.com/agdl/GoPRO which works only on arduino boards with gopro HERO3, this works also on ESP8266 both as standalone board or with AT-commands (ESP01)
